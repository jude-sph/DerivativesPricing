"With derivatives you can have almost any payoff pattern you want.
If you can draw it on paper, or describe it in words,
someone can design a derivative that gives you that payoff."
- Fischer Black

EXOTIC:
underlying asset assumed to follow a geometric Brownian motion
dS = mu * S * dt + sigma * S * dz
where
mu = expected instantaneous rate of return on the underlying asset
sigma = instantaneous volatility of the rate of return
dz = a Wiener process
volatility and risk free rate assumed to be constant throughout option lifetime
most formulas written on a general form
including a cost-of-carry term
which makes it possible to use the same formula to price options on a large class of underlying assets
formulas are closed-form solutions
so can only be used on european options


Variable purchase options (VPO)
a VPO is basically a call option.
But where the number of underlying shares is stochastic rather than fixed
or more precisely, a deterministic function of the asset price
the strike price of a VPO is typically a fixed discount to the underlying share price at maturity
the payoff at maturity is equal to 


I think i will use 3 to 5 methods of valuation
then display the mean and the median of the prices
numerical methods, not closed formulas

European options:
Arithmetic Monte Carlo (more accurate) 8
IQMC (importance sampling) OR Quasi random Monte Carlo (both faster) 8

American options:
American Monte Carlo (very slow) 8


Both:
Trinomial trees (more efficient and flexible than binomial) 7
Explicit finite difference 7
Implicit finite difference 7
Crank-Nicholson method (these 3 can value most single asset options) 7


I will price European options because of bigger choice (can do monte carlo without being too slow)
Or maybe American barrier options (for no other reason than I hear that is difficult)

American Barrier options:
Trinomial trees 7 - more efficient and flexible than binomial
Finite differences 7
    Explicit
    Implicit - simpler, may require smaller time steps for stability
    Crank-Nicholson - balance of accuracy and stability
American Monte Carlo 8 - flexible for high dimensional and path dependent options
